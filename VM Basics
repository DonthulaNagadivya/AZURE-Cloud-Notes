What is Azure Compute
Azure Compute is a cloud service that provides processing power, memory, and networking resources to run applications using services like Azure VMs, App Services, and Functions.
................................
2. What are the different types of compute services available in Azure
The different compute services in Azure include Virtual Machines (VMs) for IaaS, App Services for hosting web apps (PaaS), Azure Functions for serverless computing, and Azure Container Instances and Kubernetes for containerized workloads.
................................
3. What is the difference between Azure App Service and Azure Virtual Machine
Azure App Service is a PaaS offering to deploy and run applications without managing infrastructure. Azure Virtual Machine is an IaaS offering that gives full control over the OS, CPU, memory, and storage for hosting apps in the cloud.

4. What are Availability Sets and how do they help in Azure VM high availability
Availability Sets protect Azure VMs from rack-level and hardware failures by distributing VMs across multiple fault and update domains. This ensures that if one VM goes down, others continue running, providing high availability.

5. What is the difference between Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling in Azure VMs
Vertical scaling increases the CPU or memory of a single VM, while horizontal scaling adds or removes VM instances based on demand to handle load efficiently.
---------------------------------
6. What are Availability Zones in Azure and how are they different from Availability Sets
Availability Zones protect workloads from datacenter-level failures by distributing VMs across physically separate zones within a region. Unlike Availability Sets (which protect against rack-level failures), Zones ensure high availability even if an entire datacenter goes down.
-------------------------------------
7. What is Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) and how does it help in scaling applications
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) automatically manage and scale multiple VMs based on defined metrics. It offers two scaling options: vertical scaling (increasing CPU/memory of a single VM) and horizontal scaling (adding/removing VM instances based on demand).
-----------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between Azure App Services and Azure Functions
Azure app service is a PAAS offering for deploying and running web applications, with azure managing the underlying infrastructure.
Azure functions is a serverless computing service, where code runs only in response to events and resources are allocated automatically based on demand.
